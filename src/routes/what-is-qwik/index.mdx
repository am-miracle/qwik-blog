# What is Qwik city?

Qwik City is built on top of Qwik, bringing opinionated routing and a lot of features such as layouts, templating, data fetching, bundle optimization, prefetching, streaming, and interoperability with edge function providers out of the box to make development easier and faster. Qwik is said to be the core framework, which can maintain stability by avoiding breaking changes and concentrating on long-term, stable primitives and component models.
